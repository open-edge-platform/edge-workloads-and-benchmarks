# Security scan workflow

# This workflow is triggered on schedule, workflow_dispatch, and pushes to main and release branches and:
# - scans GitHub Actions workflows for security issues (Zizmor)
# - performs static security analysis of Python code (Bandit)
# - scans for vulnerabilities, secrets, and misconfigurations (Trivy)
